# Crystal Lake Neighborhood Association
Newton, MA

Crystal Lake is a beautiful natural resource in the midst of a quiet residential neighborhood in Newton, MA. The Crystal Lake neighborhood has a long tradition as a family-friendly neighborhood that extends a warm welcome to visitors who come to enjoy the neighborhood and the Lake. The *Crystal Lake Neighborhood Association* (CLNA) is a neighborhood group dedicated to the conservation of the Crystal Lake neighborhood and to the promotion of its family-friendly and welcoming tradition. 

### Traffic & Parking Proposal

In recent years, the number of summertime visitors to the Crystal Lake neighborhood has grown dramatically and is stretching the capacity of the neighborhood to accommodate them. The CLNA proposes the establishment of a *Crystal Lake Parking District* as a means to manage traffic and parking in the Crystal Lake neighborhood during the summer months.
