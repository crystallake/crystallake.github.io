# Crystal Lake Neighborhood Association

## Draft

Crystal Lake is a beautiful landmark in the midst of a quiet residential neighborhood in Newton, MA. The Crystal Lake neighborhood has a long tradition of extending a warm welcome to visitors who come to enjoy the neighborhood and the Lake. In recent years, the number of summertime visitors has grown dramatically and is stretching the capacity of the neighborhood to accommodate them. The Crystal Lake Neighborhood Association (CLNA) is dedicated to the presevation of the Crystal Lake Neighborhood. The CLNA proposes that the City of Newton manage the area by establishing a Crystal Lake Parking District enforced during the summer season.
